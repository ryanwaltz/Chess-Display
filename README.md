# Chess-Display

This is a project about my code which displays chess pieces

Full disclosure, the pieces are directly stolen from chess.coms default appearance. Everything else is unique code.

# Chess board

This is my initial attempt at creating a chessboard. It uses many different classes and methods to use as the logic for it. Comments are few and far between, and often aren't even descriptive. The code is buggy (note the bishop moving sometimes causes a crash) and has many errors. Despite this bad code, I have decided to keep it as a reference and as alternative code in case the refactor breaks / I need new methods.

# Chess board refactored

This is my second attempt at creating a chessboard. This version is actually clean code with comments. I chose not to simply edit the preexisting code as I would have had to rework too many things. Although there are clunky pieces of code, it is much better than the previous version. Currently, I have implemented everything you would normally see in a casual chess app; you're only able to make legal moves, you can't move into check, through pins or discoveries, castling, all much more. I have implemented a timer system and next I will attempt to create a way that two users can play against each other with the help of a server.
